# [PROJECT NAME HERE]

[PROJECT SHORT DESCRIPTION HERE]

## **IMPORTANT NOTES CONCERNING THE TEMPLATE**

After creating the repository, perform the steps detailed in [the current version of the Git workflow document](https://hackmd.informatik.uni-bremen.de/s/w8tkKT_SZ).

The most important steps that need to be performed are:
1. Set at least one maintainer **in the CODEOWNERS file**, **at the end of this README document** and **in the GitLab project member settings (under "Project information")**.
2. Check that the **push rules**, the **merge approval and merge request settings** as well as the **protected branch settings** match the ones detailed in the Git workflow document.
3. Check that the License suggested in this template (Apache 2.0/MIT dual license) is actually the one you want for this project.
4. Enable/disable GitLab project features as needed (Settings->General)
4. Update this README file, adding a short repository description and other relevant information (like build instructions) and removing this part of the document.
5. **Rewrite/Replace** the initial commit so that the first commit includes all the changes you have made (as well as other things the repository should inlcude in the first commit) and **force push** the initial commit (you might have to disable the branch protection temporarily for this).

If there are any questions or suggestions you can contact the Git workflow group (@s_edhnm5, @falko1, @hdamer) via Mattermost.
